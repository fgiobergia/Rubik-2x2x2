Rubik's Cube 2x2x2 
Developed using Unity ( http://unity3d.com/ )

Description:
This was supposed to be my first work using Unity Game Engine. Problem is, I 
somehow managed to delete the whole project :'(. All I have left is the 
executable file and the javascript scripts.

Usage:
Extract Rubik2x2x2.exe and Rubik2x2x2_Data.
Run Rubik2x2x2.exe and choose the settings that best suit you.
Now, you can scramble/solve the cube using these keys:

Up arrow		View from top
Down arrow		View from bottom
Left arrow		Rotate counterclockwise (Y axis)
Right arrow		Rotate clockwise (Y axis)
8 (numeric keypad)	Rotate counterclockwise (X axis)
2 (numeric keypad)	Rotate clockwise (X axis)
4 (numeric keypad)	Rotate counterclockwise (Z axis)
6 (numeric keypad)	Rotate clockwise (Z axis)
E			Up
W			Up Inverted
X			Down
Z			Down Inverted
S			Left
A			Left Inverted
F			Right
D			Right Inverted
C			Front
Shift			Front Inverted
Tab			Back
R			Back Inverted

Special thanks to Paolo Guzzo, who provided me with the "cubes" :-)
